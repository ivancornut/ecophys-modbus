# Ecophys-Modbus
Using Pi Picos, RS485 and ModBus to create robust environmental networks tahta are able to operate in constrained conditions (low access to ressources, harsh climate, etc). 

## Objectives
We aim to build a low-cost, robust and resilient sensor network to charaterise heterogeneous environments. In our case mainly complex agroforestry systems in Central Africa (Cameroon).
