# Ecophys-Modbus
Using Pi Picos, RS485 and ModBus to create robust environmental networks tahta are able to operate in constrained conditions (low access to ressources, harsh climate, etc). 

## Objectives
We aim to build a low-cost, robust and resilient sensor network to characterize heterogeneous environments. In our case we work mainly in complex cocoa agroforestry systems in Central Africa (Cameroon). These systems are multi-layered and have a high diverity of shade and understory trees. In this context placing a few micro-environmental sensors is not sufficient to guarantee a good estimation of the effects of shade trees on the micro-evironment of cocoa trees.
